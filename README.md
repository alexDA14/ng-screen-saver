087132# NgScreenSaver

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.6.

## Before run app

Run `npm install` or `npm i` to install all dependencies for Angular application.

## Run development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## NOTE:

Current solution is not a best as could be, but pretty easy and fast in implementation. Of course, I didn't `'unsubscribed'` from subscriptions, but come on... I made all logic in the `app.component.ts`, which is definitely not good for a real project, but if `app.component.ts` destroyed - all app will be destroyed to :)

I just made it simple and quick. Thanks.
